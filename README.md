# DoorKickers2_FUBAR_Difficulty_Mod
**"Death is waiting around every corner. Only a madman would attempt this."
-Spec Ops: The Line**

Inspired by Spec Ops: The Line's FUBAR Difficulty, Metro 2033's Ranger Mode, and the original Rainbow Six trilogy, FUBAR Difficulty Mod changes combat in Door Kickers 2 to be highly lethal. Everyone has 25% of their base health values, and dies after taking about 1-3 bullets.

Note that your Troopers WILL spawn in as badly injured because they only have 25% health now. It is normal behavior.

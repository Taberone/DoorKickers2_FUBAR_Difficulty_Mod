TABERONE'S PERSONAL UNBALANCING - DOOR KICKERS 2 (EARLY ACCESS 11.0)
Install in Steam\steamapps\common\DoorKickers2\data\mods

1) This mod reduces everyone's health to at least a fourth of their base hit points, making everyone die faster and hopefully making the gameplay like Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield where it consistently takes only 1-3 bullets to kill someone.
